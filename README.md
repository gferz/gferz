# Gabriel's Github Profile 😎

<div align='justify'>
Hi there 👋, my name is Gabriel. I'm currently studying at Universitas Gadjah Mada as Information Engineering student. I am interested in many aspects of software engineering. I love software engineering and programming in general such as low level stuff like kernel or operating system development, as well as high level stuff like web development. I practiced project-based learning while learning theoretical concepts to complement my understanding. Currently, i'm working as a computer vision and software programmer at Gadjah Mada Robotic Team and backend web developer at Technocorner DTETI UGM.
